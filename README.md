# 🚶‍♂️ Analyzing an SCG Signal Step-by-Step

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates the process of analyzing SCG (Seismocardiogram) signals, focusing on detecting and analyzing the vibrations of the heart and body during movements. SCG signals are used to monitor cardiac health, especially during physical activity. This guide provides a detailed breakdown of the SCG signal processing pipeline, from acquisition to feature extraction and visualization.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- **SCG Signal Processing**: Preprocessing techniques like noise removal and filtering.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features like heart rate, body movement information, and vibrations.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the SCG signal to detect heart-related vibrations.
- **Machine Learning (Optional)**: Using extracted features to predict cardiovascular health and body movement patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** 🐍
- **NumPy** 🔢 (For numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib** 📊 (For visualization)
- **SciPy** 🔬 (For signal processing)
- **BioSPPy** 🧬 (For biosignal processing)
- **HeartPy** ❤️ (For heart rate extraction from SCG)
- **Pandas** 📊 (For data handling)

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **SCG Signal Acquisition**: Collect raw SCG data using devices such as wearable sensors or databases.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean the SCG signal by applying noise reduction techniques (e.g., low-pass or bandpass filters) to focus on heart-related vibrations.
3. **Peak Detection**: Detect peaks corresponding to the heartbeats or body movements in the SCG signal. **BioSPPy** can help in identifying the key events in the signal.
4. **Heart Rate & Movement Detection**: Measure the heart rate from the SCG signal by analyzing the time between peaks. You can also extract body movement features during physical activity.
5. **Visualization**: Use **Matplotlib** to plot the SCG signal and visualize the heartbeats and body movement events.
6. **Feature Extraction**: Extract key features such as the heart rate, acceleration patterns, or movement frequency, which can be used for classification tasks.
7. **Optional - Machine Learning**: Apply machine learning techniques using features from the SCG signal to detect abnormal heart conditions, assess fitness levels, or monitor physical activities.
